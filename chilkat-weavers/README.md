# Today's Chilkat Weavers

A web app to showcase current Chilkat Weavers.  A platform for weavers to sign up, share who they are and the weavings that they do.  This app is intended to work towards Cultural Revitalization by highlighting Indigenous voices, their culture and stories.  Chilkat weavers are still current and valued today.
